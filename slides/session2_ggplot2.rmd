# ggplot2

The "gg" in `ggplot2` stands for the "Grammar of Graphics." The grammar of graphics is a philosophy of data visualization which forces you to think about *what* you want to visualize *how*. [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) followed this philosophy to implement the `ggplot2` package.



```{r, fig.height = 2, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 2, dpi = 200, units = "in",echo =F, eval = T}
library(ggplot2)
data(hadley, package="ggmap")
img <- hadley
ggplot()  + 
  annotation_raster(hadley, xmin=-Inf, xmax=Inf, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,dim(img)[2]),expand=c(0,0))+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,dim(img)[1]),expand=c(0,0))+
  coord_fixed() + theme_bw()
```

# The anatomy of a ggplot2 plot

The grammar of graphics specifies **building blocks** out of which an analyst builds a plot. These include, in the order of application:

1. Data (*what* do you want to plot?)
2. Aesthetic mapping (what comes on the x and y axes? )
3. Geometric object (`geoms`)  (How do we want to see our data? Points, lines, bars, ...)
4. Add more `geoms` (e.g. add regression lines to a scatterplot)
5. Polish labels, scales, legends, and appearance.

(see [this link](http://socviz.co/makeplot.html#build-your-plots-layer-by-layers) for more details)

# ggplot2 building blocks

Let's look at the ggplot2 building blocks in practice:

```{r, echo = T, warning = F, units = "in", dpi=200, eval = T, fig.height = 2, fig.align = "center"}
library(gapminder) # loads the gapminder data
library(tidyverse) # loads ggplot2 and other packages

example_plot <- ggplot(data = gapminder, # specify which dataset to use
                       aes(x = year, # what goes on the x axis?
                           y = lifeExp )) + # what's on the y axis?
  geom_point() # with which geometric object should the data be displayed?

```

Note the `+` that ties the building blocks together.

# Combining geoms II

```{r, echo = T, warning = F, eval = T, units = "in", dpi = 200, fig.height = 2, fig.align = "center"}
library(gapminder) 
library(tidyverse) 

example_plot <- ggplot(data = gapminder, 
                       aes(x = year, 
                           y = lifeExp)) +  
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", 
              color = "firebrick") # fix smoother color

```

Bonus question: in this example we fix the color, i.e. we map it to a fixed value (`firebrick` which is red). What happens if we would map `color` to a variable in the gapminder dataset, such as `continent`?

# Manipulate and Preprocess Data 

Subsetting/filtering data helps to reduce complexity & get at the comparison that we want. To do that, we use the `dplyr` package which is part of the `tidyverse`. 

To filter data, we use the `filter()` function.

```{r, echo = T, eval = T}
library(tidyverse) # loads dplyr package, among others
library(gapminder)

gapminder_americas <- gapminder %>% # the %>% `chains` together functions
  filter(continent == "Americas") # that's two "=" 

head(gapminder_americas, 5)

```

---

# Manipulate and Preprocess Data 

Modify/add variables to existing data frame. We modify data with the `mutate()` function and chain them together using the pipe operator ` %>% `.

```{r, echo = T, eval = T}
library(tidyverse) # loads dplyr package, among others
library(gapminder)

gapminder_americas <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Americas") %>% 
  # create a character/categorical variable
  # to distinguish between North/South America
  mutate(north_america = ifelse(country == "United States" |
                                  country == "Canada", 
                                "north_america", 
                                "south_america"))
head(gapminder_americas,3)

```

---

# Manipulate and Preprocess Data 

Use filtered and preprocessed data to highlight comparisons in ggplot:

```{r, echo = T, eval = T, units = "in", dpi = 200, fig.height = 3, fig.align = "center"}

ggplot(gapminder_americas, # only use data for Americas
       aes(x = year, 
           y = gdpPercap, 
           color = north_america)) + # map "north_america" category to color
  geom_point()

```

---

# Exercise

Plot the development of population size (`pop` variable in the gapminder data) over time (`year` variable in the gapminder data) in Asia (hint: `continent == "Asia"`). Add a trend line and/or smooth line. 

Bonus exercise: Plot the relationship between population size `pop` and `gdpPercap`! (hint: might make sense to wrap `pop` and `gdpPercap` in `log()`).



---

# Solution

```{r, echo = T, eval = T, units = "in", dpi = 200, fig.height = 2, fig.align = "center"}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

gapminder_asia <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") 

asia_pop <- ggplot(gapminder_asia, 
                   aes(x = year, y = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

print(asia_pop)

```

  # create a categorical variable that distinguishes
