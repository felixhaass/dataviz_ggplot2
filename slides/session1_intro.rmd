# Learning Objectives

- Learn principles of how to use the `ggplot2` package to create informative data visualizations  
- We will learn mechanics of the software package, rather than good visualization principles. For infos on that, see course page (watch out for the dataviz ninja, though!).   
- Know where to find help

---

# Course Principles

- Ask questions at any time!
- Collaborate with your neighbours! 
- Individual preferences/data visualization problems are most welcome!

# R Refresher - What is R?

- `R` is a programming language for statistical analysis
    - "Programming language": repeat tedious tasks; replicability; connect to unusual data sources (Twitter, web sites, text documents, ...)
    - "statistical analysis": many packages to do any statistical analysis you want
- `RStudio` is the interactive software with which we write and execute R code, plot things, view the R memory environment (...and much more)

---

# R Refresher - Libraries

R uses different **libraries** or **packages** to load specific functions (read excel files, talk to Twitter, generate plots, ...): https://cran.r-project.org/. You load a package or a library with the command

```{r libraries, echo = T, eval = F}
library(read_excel) # read_excel is the package name (without quotation marks)

```

If a command throws an error, chances are you either 

- forgot to load the respective library
- have a syntax error - **R is case sensitive!** 

To install a **package** we use:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}

install.packages("gapminder") # with quotation marks!

```


---

# R Refresher - Assignment

In R, we assign **stuff** (numbers, characters, data frames) to **things** (objects)

```{r assignments, echo = T, eval = T}
url <- "http://gmi.bicc.de/index.php?page=ranking-table"

```

- `url`: object, in this case: a character vector 
- `"http://gmi.bicc.de/index.php?page=ranking-table"`: "stuff" (URL, could be any text or number)   
- `<-`: assign command, type `<` and `-` (shortcut: <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> in RStudio)  

---

# R Refresher - Objects

In R, everything is an object--and you can have multiple objects in your memory at the same time!

```{r multiple_objects, eval=F, echo = T}
# 1st object: assign numbers to a vector
numbers <- 1:5

# 2nd object: read data from an excel sheet
sipri <- read_excel("./data/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2016_cleaned.xlsx", 
                    sheet = 5, 
                    na = c("xxx", ". ."))
```

Executing this command yields to objects in memory, `numbers` the vector of numbers and the data frame `sipri`.


---

# R Refresher - Data Frames

Data frames are rectangular data tables, like an Excel spreadsheet. 
```{r, echo = F, eval = T, messages = F, warning=F, comment=F, include = F}
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r dataframes, eval = T, echo = T, messages = F, warning=F}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)

gapminder


```


---

# Review: R Refresher

- **Libraries** are your friend! `library()` (load) them or `install.packages()` them!
- **Assign** stuff. Use `<-` for assignments!
- **Multiple objects** can and should exist in memory (if you lose track of the objects you're juggling with, check the environemnt panel at the upper right of RStudio)
- **Data frames** are the most important type of object. Don't stop until you have your data in a data frame (check data type with `class()`)!
- Bonus tip: use the help function `help(command_name)` if you can't remember a command's options.

# Organizing your Code

Having a structured way to organize your R code is useful for reproducibility (and your future sanity!)

There are two ways to improve your R code organization:

1. Folder Structure
2. RStudio Projects

---

# Organizing your Code: Folder Structure

A useful way to organize your project folders:

```{bash, eval = F, echo = T, results = "asis"}

project_name/       # name of your project
|-- code/           # here go all the .R script files
|-- data/           # here's your data
|   |-- input/       # raw input data file (experimental results, existing datasets)
    |-- output/      # transformed and cleaned datasets for analysis
|-- manuscript/     # your manuscript, i.e. .docx or LaTeX files
|-- figures/        # your figures as separate files 
|-- output/         # tables

```



---

# Organizing your Code: RStudio Projects

An RStudio project takes care of several useful steps in your project. When you load an RStudio project, the following steps are taken:

- Sets the working directory to the project directory
- A new R session (process) is started (with no libraries)
- Previously edited source documents are restored into editor tabs
- Other RStudio settings (e.g. active tabs, splitter positions, etc.) are restored to where they were the last time the project was closed.
- [...and others, see https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects]

# Organizing your Code: Setting up an RStudio Project {.columns-2}

In RStudio, go to File => New Project => "Existing Directory"

# Reading Data

To read `.csv` files, the the `read_csv()` function in the `readr` package is useful (automatically loaded through `library(tidyverse)`).

To read Excel files, use the `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package, which needs to be loaded separately.

To read files from Stata or SPSS, use `read_dta()` or `read_spss()` from the `haven` package, which needs to be loaded separately. 

Example:

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

sipri <- read_excel("./data/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2016_cleaned.xlsx", 
                    sheet = 5, na = c("xxx", ". ."))

```


To read R files (`.rda` or `.rdata`), simply use `load("name_of_my_file.rda"`)

Also useful: the `rio` package!

# Exercise

1. Create organized folder structure
2. Download the SIPRI data from the course website
3. Create an R script to read the data (hint: remember that the Excel file has several sheets!)

---

# Solution



```{r, eval = T, echo = T, dev="CairoPNG", dpi = 200, fig.height = 3}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

sipri <- read_excel("./data/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2016_cleaned.xlsx", 
                    sheet = 5, na = c("xxx", ". ."))

sipri_plot <- sipri %>%
  # from wide to long format with the `gather function
  gather(key = year, 
         value = military_expenditure, 
         -Country) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = year, 
                y = military_expenditure, 
                group = Country)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5)

```

---

# Solution

```{r, echo = T, eval = T, , dev="CairoPNG", warning = F,  dpi = 200, fig.height = 3}
print(sipri_plot)

```
